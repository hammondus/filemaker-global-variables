# filemaker global variables

A series of filemaker custom functions that allows you to store many global variables, using on a single Filemaker $$GLOBAL variable.

Each variable is stored in a JSON object, so like any JSON object, the data can be grouped in a hierarchical manner.

The actual name of the filemaker $$GLOBAL variable to use is only set once, so there is only 1 change you need to
make to use a different filemaker variable.
